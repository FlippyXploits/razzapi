Guide that explains usage of RazzAPI
Api made by me @Filip343Filip

1.  Prepare the Project and Files:
    *   Switch to x64 Build: In Visual Studio, go to "Build" -> "Configuration Manager". Under "Active solution platform", select "x64" from the dropdown. If it's not available, click "New..." and choose "x64".
    *   Extract Files: From the RazzAPI folder, extract the `RazzAPI.dll` file and put it in the the `bin` folder of your project.
    *   Place Files: Move both the `RazzAPI.dll` file and the entire `bin` folder into the *output directory* of your project. This is typically located in `[Your Project Folder]\bin\x64\Debug` or `[Your Project Folder]\bin\x64\Release`, depending on your build configuration.

1.5 Make sure you have libcrypto-3-x64.dll and libssl-3-x64.dll in Debug/bin

2.  Add Reference:
    *   In your Visual Studio project, right-click on "References" in the Solution Explorer.
    *   Select "Add Reference".
    *   Browse to the location of the RazzAPI.dll file.
    *   Select the library and click "Add".

3.  Include Namespace:
    *   In your C# code files, add the following line at the top:
        using RazzAPI;

4. Initialize RazzAPI like this:

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            Comunication.Start
        }

or. if you only want to run the updater: 

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            Updater.AutoUpdateXenoDll();
        }

5.  API Functions:

    *   AutoUpdate:
        Updater.AutoUpdateXenoDll();
        Will Update dlls in bin folder(if needed)

    *   Attach:
        Modules.Inject();

    *   Execute Script:
        Modules.ExecuteScript(script);

        Executes a provided script in Roblox.  Replace `script` with the script string.(richTextbox.Text for example)

    *   Kill Roblox:
        Utilities.KillRoblox();

        Kills the Roblox process.


    *   Injection and execution notifier:
	UseExecutionNotifier()
	public static void UseRazzNotifier(string MainText, string Subtext)

        modifiable.
